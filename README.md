SS BG Export / Import
=====================

Creates a model admin that can be used to export and import bulk data records
on a class by class basis

## Why?

1. Once you hit ~10 000 records SS chokes and can't export anything due to the
length of time it takes to create the CSV
2. You only get the output of the Summary fields on the DataObject so it was never
suitable for complete export / import

## todo

- when generating field list
--> get fields for class and all subclasses
--> validate fields during other operations
- tighten up premissions - most likely i had weird users / groups so i used 777 :-0
